            Some children grew up being strong and resilient, not because they want to, but because they have to. Children with Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) parents are the children who have to learn how to grow up by themselves; they need to learn from their own. In order to support their children financially, a lot of Filipino parents chose to work abroad to support their families, especially their children. However it results in the challenges that the children face; they struggle academically, socially, and emotionally. Even though the love from their parents is there, their situation will never be easy, because the love they give from a distance will always feel different. This platform is for the left behind children, this will serve as their voice to share their experiences and stories.

            Who are the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)?
          </h2>
            <p>
              Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) are Filipino citizens who work and live abroad for a limited period of time, usually under the terms of a specific employment contract. Families, particularly parents, often choose to work abroad in order to provide for their children’s needs and secure their future, especially in the face of poverty. As of now, the <strong>Philippines</strong> is recognized as one of the largest exporters of overseas workers in the world.
            <p>
              The hard work and courage of OFWs have been recognized countless times, with each of their personal experiences often resonating with others. Every day, they navigate foreign cultures and endure the emotional pain of being separated from their families. However, they are not the only ones facing challenges; their families, especially their children, are also deeply affected by their absence.

            Parental Absence Due to Overseas Work
          </h2>
            <p>
              Parents play a crucial role in shaping their children's physical and emotional growth. Physical and mental development begins in childhood—a stage that requires guidance and support from parents. However, in the Philippines, 18% of children live only with their mothers, 4% live only with their fathers, and 7% are raised by their grandparents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most common reasons for parental absence include <em>separation, the death of a parent, and parents working abroad.</em> In the Philippines, many parents choose to seek better opportunities by working overseas rather than staying with their families. While this may help address financial problems, it often leaves children behind—those who are most affected and who bear the greatest emotional and social consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parental absence can have adverse effects on a child’s overall well-being, decision-making, behavior, and coping strategies. Without proper parental guidance, children are more likely to develop high rates of alcoholism, perform poorly in school, and engage in dangerous activities. These consequences often appear as challenges in their <strong>academic, social, and emotional well-being.</strong>

          <h2>
            Three Common Challenges Faced by OFWs Children
          </h2>
            <h3>
              Academic Performance
            </h3>
              <p>
                The achievement of the student acquired from their school is typically measured by classroom performance and test scores. In addition, academic performance is the term that identifies a student's achievements after completing a subject or course at an institution. It is used to know the level of students' learning, mainly from their complied assessment by formative and summative.
              </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Difficulty in concentration and focus</strong>
                      <p>
                        Students who have parents working overseas experience difficulties in concentration and focus. They struggle to concentrate on their studies and become less motivated to pursue school tasks. When there is not enough parental guidance, it becomes hard for them to focus, causing loss of attention, sadness from missing their parents, and lower motivation. In the long run, this lack of support becomes a challenge to their school progress. The absence of an OFW parent negatively affects the learner’s focus, interest, and overall academic performance.
                      </p> 
                      <p>
                        As explained by Annor et al. (2024), there are several reasons for parental absence, such as death, divorce, abandonment, or migration. The absence of one or both parents has a similar effect on children, regardless of the cause. In addition, Mwai (2018) emphasized that adults who experienced emotionally absent parents during their childhood often carry deep sadness and a sense of loss. Even though parents working abroad may provide better financial stability, their children face the emotional consequences of separation, such as loneliness, deprivation, and feelings of abandonment. These consequences affect not only their well-being but also their decisions, behaviors, and coping strategies. Moreover, limited communication and the inability to fully express emotions often create a gap in the relationship between the child and the parent.
                      </p> 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Lack of guidance in school work</strong>
                      <p>
                        The lack of parental help makes it difficult for students to manage their time and complete schoolwork. Without parents’ reminders, they need to rely on self-discipline and motivation to finish tasks and meet deadlines. Students find it challenging to study due to the lack of parental guidance and presence, which affects both their motivation and time management. They also struggle with assignments and projects because of limited time and focus, showing how the absence of parental support makes schoolwork harder to handle. The lack of parental guidance causes them to encounter different academic challenges.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        According to Zhang (2021), the lack of parental guidance has negative effects on children, particularly in their individual development. Material support alone cannot compensate for parental absence, as children often feel neglected, which can affect their psychological growth and even lead to cognitive problems. Children of OFW parents also tend to score lower in school due to a lack of concentration in the classroom. Furthermore, Mao, Zang, and Zhang (2020) emphasized that long-term parental absence contributes to emotional and behavioral issues, which may result in poor academic performance. Without parents to assist them with assignments or projects, many children experience loneliness and longingness, making it difficult for them to perform well in school.

                </ul>
            <h3>
              Socialization
            </h3>
              <p>
               The term is used to describe how people interact with each other in the society. Socialization includes the process of learning and teaching, acquiring knowledge and skills from the society and imparting knowledge to others. Adding more to the information, socialization is the process where individuals learn different behaviors, norms, and values through peers or other people. Doing activities or having a small chat with each other.
              </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Fear of abandonment</strong>
                      <p>
                        Children of OFW parents often experience a fear of abandonment in their social lives. They shared that once they get close to someone, they begin to fear being abandoned. Living in constant fear of people leaving makes it difficult for them to build lasting relationships. This issue affects their capacity to establish and preserve relationships.
                      </p> 
                      <p>
                        According to Gaspan and Sansot (2024), left-behind children can experience different emotions at once; the absence of their parents can adversely affect their physical and emotional development. The left-behind children often feel alone and abandoned due to the absence of their parents. The Filipino parents choose to take the risk of working abroad in an attempt to provide the needs of their family. Although they meet the financial needs of their family, especially their children, the proper guidance and emotional support are neglected. However, children who can manage their emotions well tend to feel less anxious even when their parents are not around.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Barriers to social interaction</strong>
                      <p>
                        Some children of OFW parents struggle with social connections due to feelings of insecurity and shyness. They find it difficult to communicate and form friendships, making social interaction a significant obstacle. Shyness becomes more evident in the absence of parental support, especially when meeting new people. They often find it hard to talk to those they do not know well, which limits opportunities to build friendships. This difficulty in openness and vulnerability further hinders their ability to establish social relationships.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As explained by Graham and Jordan (2015), children may become more aggressive, defiant, or overly shy if both parents do not provide consistent guidance. According to certain studies, OFW kids often have trouble making positive peer relationships and may grow up feeling insecure or low on self-esteem. Furthermore, some children may have attachment disorders. This can affect their ability to trust others or show their emotions. As a result, they might experience behavior issues at home and school, or they may become socially withdrawn. Early intervention and emotional support are key to helping these children deal with the loss of a parent. Support from parents or peers can play a critical role in helping young people manage and alleviate this emotional burden. Apart from academic and socialization, children can also face difficulties in adjusting their emotions as a result of parental absence.

                    <strong>Feeling different compared to peers</strong>

                      <p>
                        As stated by Rendeza (2017), loneliness & emotional disconnection: children of overseas foreign workers frequently experience emotional distance from their working parent. When separated from a parent for an extended time, many teenagers feel intense longing, sadness, and even confusion. Emotional disengagement and trouble trusting others can result from these emotions. Forming and maintaining meaningful friendships becomes increasingly difficult in the presence of emotional distance. When emotions remain unaddressed, issues such as anxiety or depression may arise.

              Affective Adaptation

              <p>
               The process of adjusting emotional reactions, behaviors, and perception to adapt to new challenges. It allows people to control their emotions effectively even in difficulties. Furthermore, affective adaptation is the way of balancing emotions in the face of internal and external stressors. This makes the cognitive process easy through adaptation and acceptance.

                    <strong>Sadness and loneliness</strong>
                      <p>
                        Children with OFW parents face challenges in emotional adaptation. They feel sad and anxious during the first weeks of separation and constantly miss their parents, often crying at night. They also experience loneliness and sadness, with some feeling envy toward classmates who have complete families. Feelings of being left out and incomplete without a parent are also evident. These findings show that the absence of a parent has a strong emotional impact, particularly on their identity and emotional stability.
                      </p> 
                      <p>
                        According to Capol et al. (2024), even with the Philippines' economic progress, most Filipino parents still choose to work overseas, putting their kids in the care of other family members. These children may experience undetected emotional difficulties as a result of this arrangement; they gradually learn to suppress their feelings and endure in silence. When a parent leaves to work overseas, it can cause a range of intense emotions, including loneliness, stress, and despair. Their feelings do not entirely disappear, though; rather, the children learn to cope with the situation, adapting their feelings to fit it, and the initial anguish or loss may lessen.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Mixed emotion of sadness and inspiration</strong>
                      <p>
                        Children with OFW parents feel sadness and longing during special occasions such as birthdays and holidays. Despite these feelings, they also express pride in their parents’ sacrifices and hard work abroad, which gives them inspiration. Some children feel sad when thinking about the hardships their parents might be facing, yet they cope by finding motivation in the sacrifices being made for their future.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Gaspan and Sasot (2024) found that children who are left behind may feel a variety of emotions at once, and their physical and emotional development may suffer as a result of their parents' absence. Due to their parents' absence, the children who are left behind frequently experience feelings of loneliness and abandonment. In an effort to support their family, the Filipino parents decide to take the chance of working overseas. Even if they provide for their family's financial requirements, particularly those of their kids, they fail to provide the right kind of emotional support and guidance. Even when their parents are not around, kids who are good at controlling their emotions typically experience less anxiety.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Longing for parental presence</strong>
                      <p>
                        The absence of a parent has a significant effect on children. They need their parent’s care and presence as part of their growth and often miss them. This shows that the emotional needs of the child are affected when a parent is not physically present to provide support and affection.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        According to Alcaide et al. (2024), a large number of Filipinos have chosen to work overseas in order to meet their daily necessities because of the dearth of employment possibilities and low earnings in the Philippines. They are able to offer their children financial support, but they have failed to provide them with emotional support, so they are left to rely on themselves. The majority of Filipino children in the Philippines who have OFW parents experience mental discomfort; they are particularly vulnerable to depression because of their parents' physical absence. They might also experience feelings of loneliness, sadness, and homesickness. It is essential to comprehend these feelings since they have a direct impact on the children's general well-being; having OFW parents can have both positive and negative effects.

            Impact of Parental Absence on OFWs Children Personal Development

                  <strong>Learning independence while coping with sadness</strong>
                    <p>
                      Parental absence produces both positive and negative outcomes for children of OFW parents. On the positive side, the separation eases family financial struggles, teaches self-reliance, and helps children grow more responsible and independent. On the negative side, it creates emotional distance, feelings of sadness, loneliness, and a deep sense of longing for their parents.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                      According to Unicef (2017), the absence of parents can greatly influence a child’s overall development, as proper guidance and emotional support become limited. Prolonged separation often leads to emotional distress, loneliness, and feelings of abandonment, which can further affect a child’s academic, social, and emotional well-being. Additionally, as indicated by Ramos (2020), the absence of their parents can cause a lot of problems that the left-behind children. The children that are left-behind can develop independence and can easily be influenced by other people. In result, many children that go to school may find a proper job, while other can’t.

                  <strong>Responsibility and resilience amid loneliness</strong>
                    <p>
                      The sacrifices of OFW parents motivate children to become more responsible, developing a sense of responsibility and toughness in their daily lives. However, despite these positive outcomes, they continue to experience sadness, loneliness, and the emotional weight of their parents’ absence, especially during special occasions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Capol et al. (2024) stated that the feeling of isolation, loneliness, abandonment, deprivation, and the possible health risks. Children often feel emotional separation with their parents, even if their parents provide the material needs of them to fill their absence. Moreover, Abenir (2019) emphasize that the earlier literature review indicates that left-behind children usually deal with more problems when their mother or main caregiver is the one working away, but the impact of family separation has brought both advantages and disadvantages. This could mean that despite being apart from their parent(s), these children have learned to build resilience. While the pain of separation still leaves them vulnerable, they are making efforts to continue with their lives.

                  <strong>Motivated by sacrifice while longing for parental care</strong>
                    <p>
                      The sacrifices of OFW parents serve as motivation for children to study harder and perform well in school. This sense of inspiration pushes them to value their education and become more determined in their academic responsibilities. However, the absence of maternal care and presence also creates struggles. Without the necessary parental support, children find it difficult to meet their academic needs, showing how motivation and challenges coexist in their educational experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Lobos et al. (2019) emphasize that parental absence tend to cause loneliness and a yearning for parental love and care, affecting children's well-being, decision-making, behavior, and coping mechanisms. Also, Basco et al. (2025) discovered that children whose parents work overseas often grow with a strong feeling of appreciation for their parents' sacrifices, pushing them to attain higher levels of academic achievement. But this motive could also introduce stress, anxiety, and alienation by teachers or figures of authority.

            Coping Mechanisms Employed by OFWs Children
          </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Coping through hobbies and social connection</strong>
                  <p>
                    Children of OFW parents use different coping mechanisms to overcome the situation. They engage in hobbies such as watching anime, dancing, reading, and rapping. They also join sports activities and other forms of recreation to divert their attention and avoid dwelling on their situation. In addition, they cope by socializing more often and seeking support from family and friends, which helps them manage their emotions and find happiness.
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                    As explained by Chen and Qu (2021), coping mechanisms are used to adapt or recover from the difficulties that they encounter, and there are two different ways to cope with the situation, the approach coping and avoidant coping. The approach coping mechanisms used emotional support from other people, while the avoidant coping mechanisms involved negative ways to deal with the challenges, and that includes self-blaming, denial and withdrawal. These mechanisms are used to help people to cope with the challenges they face. Additionally, based on the study of Basco et al. (2025), children with Overseas Filipino Workers parents seek emotional support from their relatives and friends. They are the ones who fill the absence of their parents, giving them guidance, support and security. In addition, with the help of other people, the children can have someone that they can rely on, helping them in handling loneliness.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Maintaining connection through communication</strong>
                    <p>
                      Communication serves as an important coping mechanism for children of OFW parents. They stay connected with their parents through technology, such as video calls, which helps ease sadness and reduce worries about their parents abroad. They also talk with grandparents and friends when feeling overwhelmed, which provides additional emotional support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As stated by Magantor (2024), the majority of the children that are apart from their parents due to their parents working overseas used technology to stay connected with their parents and help them to cope with the separation. Communicating with their parents through the use of technology can lessen the emotional challenges that the left-behind children experience. Moreover, seeking help from their families and friends also helps in maintaining their overall emotional and physical well-being during the time when their parents are not physically present.

            Parents' absence because of overseas work brings both good and difficult experiences for children of Overseas Filipino. Being away from their parents often leaves a space in children’s hearts that is not easy to replace. Many kids with OFW parents feel lonely, worried, and unsure about what their future will be. These feelings can affect how well they do in school and how they develop as a person. Furthermore, grandparents or other relatives may take on the role of caregivers, but no matter how much love and effort they give, it is never quite the same as having parents around. In addition, growing up without their parents around changes the way many children form friendships and see the world. Still, being far apart does not always mean losing connection. When parents abroad stay in touch, show patience, and give emotional support, family ties can remain strong despite the distance. At the same time, schools and communities have a big part to play in guiding these children and giving them programs or spaces that help them cope and continue moving forward.

            Moreover, for some children, this experience becomes a lesson in resilience. They learn independence at a young age and often grow more responsible. For others, however, the absence of a parent may bring challenges, such as struggles with behavior or making sound decisions. This is why guidance and peer support groups play an important role. These spaces give OFW children a chance to express their feelings openly, cope with difficulties, and find a healthier balance in life.
